**Disclaimer**  
The Open Building Population Layer is a personal project by Maxim Fortin. It is not an official government data source for building footprints or population.

**Introduction**  
This dataset contains population estimates at the building level for all provinces, territories and states in Canada and the US, calibrated using the most accurate census information available.

This data, along with accompanying code, can be downloaded and used freely under the licenses described below, provided the source is acknowledged.

**Why this layer was developed**  
Population density products have long been used to quantify demographic information and to assess relationships with hazards, ecosystems, human health and infrastructure. However, there is currently a gap for a fine-resolution population density product covering all provinces and territories in Canada.

While proprietary datasets presenting this type of information already exist, they can be expensive. The public availability of remote sensing and free open-source data has significantly increased in recent years, making it now easier than ever to develop good population estimates all the way down to the building level in the public domain.
